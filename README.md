College project for visualizing waste data in Amsterdam.e

## Members
Oemar, Stella & Robert

## Concept
The concept op the zero waste project is to visualize a given dataset. We combine the dataset with rich open data sets available at [Amsterdam Open Data](https://maps.amsterdam.nl/open_geodata).

We aim to create a dashboard that provides new insights to the waste problem in Amsterdam. The dashboard will read and present data in a way the user wants it to.

The dashboard comes with a detailed postalcode area map of Amsterdam and a dateselector.

The user chooses a date and the dashboard will show the waste that was produced within each postalcode area on that given day.
More rubbish means a darker color of the spectrum and vice versa.

Click on an area to learn more about the top ten companies that are based in that area.
